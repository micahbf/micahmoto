You've made it to my blog!

Today is my last day on the job, and after a few weeks of packing and preparing, I will be setting out on my motorcycle. The general plan is to ride from California through Central America, crossing the Dari√©n Gap and then continuing on exploring in South America.

I'll be posting updates and pictures here, stay tuned!

Until then, here's a picture of my old sidecar rig (R.I.P.) with a sheep and a goat in it.
